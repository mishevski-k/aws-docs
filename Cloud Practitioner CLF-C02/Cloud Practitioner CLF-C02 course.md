### Intro
- It's a challenging certificate, will be long
- Will cover 40 AWS services (out of 200+ AWS services)
- Take my time, don't rush
- Learn everyday, doing little by little
- Lean by doing - key learning technique, mix of theory and hands on
- services that are not part of the exam will not be shown in the course, but will appear as distractors for answers
- Six months of fundamental AWS Cloud and industry knowledge
- Estimated cost for this course is $12.70 per Instructor
- Most of the services will be in the AWS Free Tier = $0
- Already have some domains so maybe it will be lower for me.
